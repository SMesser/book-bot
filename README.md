This is a simple Twitter bot that constructs and tweets randomly-generated
fiction one sentence at a time. 

It originated from the template for the Build-a-Bot workshop at PyDX Conf 2015
in Portland, OR.

The character and place names are drawn from multiple sources and do not
constitute endorsement or critique of any of the original works.
